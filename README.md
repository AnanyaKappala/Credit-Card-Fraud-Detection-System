Using Machine Learning in Python

Course: Computer Networks (IT-3009)

Project Topic: Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Introduction:
The increasing prevalence of online transactions and electronic payments has led to a surge in
credit card fraud. As a response to this challenge, the field of computer networks has played a
pivotal role in the development of sophisticated fraud detection systems. This project aims to
explore the techniques and methodologies used in designing and implementing a Credit Card
Fraud Detection System, leveraging the principles of computer networks and data analysis.

Project Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Understanding Credit Card Fraud: Gain insight into various types of credit card fraud, their
common characteristics, and the importance of detecting fraudulent activities.

Exploring Data Sources: Identify and acquire relevant datasets containing credit card
transaction information for both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and transform the acquired data into a suitable format
for analysis and modeling.

Feature Extraction: Investigate relevant features from the transaction data that can serve as
inputs to the fraud detection model.

ML algorithm Selection: Study different machine learning and data mining algorithms suitable for
fraud detection, including anomaly detection, clustering, and classification methods.
Model Design: Design a credit card fraud detection system that integrates the selected
algorithms. Consider aspects such as model architecture, feature selection, and ensemble
methods.

Evaluation Metrics: Define appropriate metrics for evaluating the performance of the detection
system, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Implementation: Implement the designed system using a programming language such as
Python, and utilize relevant libraries and frameworks for machine learning and data analysis.
Validation and Testing: Validate the system using cross-validation techniques and fine-tune
parameters to achieve optimal performance.
